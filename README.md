# <HoriseonProjectcodeRefactor>

## Description

- The main motivation to work on this project was to take a more hands on approach to learning the different elements of a      webpage and how html and CSS elements work together. In short, I learned which HTML elements are best used for each specific situation and also how to better structure my CSS file so code is easy to view by other programmers. For HTML specifically, I learned more about using semantic elements based on the general structure of a webpage and also making sure that the webpage was accessible beyond the average user. For CSS, I learned that there were multiple ways to clean up and condense the current code into other classes because certain elements did not need to be reused for each section - this also included reordering the CSS code to match the structure of the html file.

Overall, this project was meant to show us a potential assignment a web developer would receieve from the "Horiseon" company and learn what a developer would do to sucessfully complete the task. The main issue the Horiseon company wanted to tackle was cleaning up their code (or refactoring) to where the developer would rewrite the current code to be more concise / easier to read without changing the external behavior or functionality.
